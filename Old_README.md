[简体中文文档](README_zh.md)
This is a app that build by PhoneGap, I am trying to use machine learning and Markov chain sag to extend audio, itis not a huge job, so I am not going to split this app to **Front End** and **Back End**, all the code is writing in JavaScript (I tried Python, that is easy to write, but that need a powerful Web Server and cannot run in a app, so I am not going to do that.)
We hope that you can fork this repo and give us a help.
